For the final project in CS 4110 Programming Languages and Logics, one of the standard options was to build an interpreter for some interesting programming language. Over the course of the class, we had looked at some simple interpreters, and I found them to be somewhat structured in their form, so I decided to write a program which, when given the specifications of a language, will automatically generate an interpreter that can handle programs written in that language.

I completed this project in python and OCaml, using the ocamllex and ocamlyacc to handle lexing and parsing. The code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Clay-Goodling/Interpreter">github.com/Clay-Goodling/Interpreter</a>.
